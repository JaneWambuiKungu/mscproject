Project title: *[Colouring Black Boxes â€“ Visualization of Decision Making of AI.]*

### Student name: *[Jane Wambui Kungu]*

### Student email: *[jwk15@student.le.ac.uk]*

### Project description: 
(AI) systems used in loan approval often function as enigmatic "black boxes," making determinations that are not readily understandable by end-users. This undertaking aims to engineer a visual framework that will offer an intuitive and participatory approach to grasp the thought processes of AI-driven loan sanctioning systems. The undertaking will inspect procedures like characteristic importance examination, verdict route tracking, and counterfactual clarifications. The objective is to engineer an apparatus that upgrades straightforwardness and trust by allowing stakeholders, including hopefuls and money related investigators, to perceive and comprehend how AI models arrive at their choices. In addition, it strives to develop dynamic and complex depictions that shed light on the internal workings of these advanced decision-makers through a mix of simplified and sophisticated representations.

### List of requirements (objectives): 

[comment]: # (You can add as many additional bullet points as necessary by adding an additional hyphon symbol '-' at the end of each list) 

Essential:
Create simple visual tools to explain AI decisions.

Show which factors influence loan approvals.

Make an easy-to-use interface for viewing decisions.

Ensure the tool works with basic AI models.

Desirable:
Provide easy-to-understand explanations for rejected loans.

Allow users to see changes when inputs are adjusted.

Support different types of AI models.

Optional:
Build a simple web-based tool for easy access.

Let users give feedback to improve explanations.

Test the tool with real users to make it better.
